## About security policies

To give people instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities in your project,{% ifversion fpt or ghes or ghec %} you can add a _SECURITY.md_ file to your repository's root, `docs`, or `.github` folder.{% else %} you can add a _SECURITY.md_ file to your repository's root, or `docs` folder.{% endif %} When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.

{% ifversion not ghae %}
<!-- no public repos in GHAE -->
You can create a default security policy for your organization or personal account. For more information, see "[Creating a default community health file](/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)."
{% endif %}

{% tip %}

**Tip:** To help people find your security policy, you can link to your _SECURITY.md_ file from other places in your repository, such as your README file. For more information, see "[About READMEs](/articles/about-readmes)."

{% endtip %}

{% ifversion fpt or ghec %}
After someone reports a security vulnerability in your project, you can use {% data variables.product.prodname_security_advisories %} to disclose, fix, and publish information about the vulnerability. For more information about the process of reporting and disclosing vulnerabilities in {% data variables.product.prodname_dotcom %}, see "[About coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities](/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/about-coordinated-disclosure-of-security-vulnerabilities#about-reporting-and-disclosing-vulnerabilities-in-projects-on-github)." For more information about repository security advisories, see "[About repository security advisories](/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-github-security-advisories)."

{% data reusables.repositories.github-security-lab %}
{% endif %}
{% ifversion ghes or ghae %}
<!-- alternative to the content about GitHub Security Advisories in the dotcom article -->
By making security reporting instructions clearly available, you make it easy for your users to report any security vulnerabilities they find in your repository using your preferred communication channel.
{% endif %}

{% data reusables.files.choose-commit-email %}
{% data reusables.files.choose_commit_branch %}
{% data reusables.files.propose_file_change %}
